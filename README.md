### OpenByFiledId
[OpenByFileId](https://github.com/nolanblew/openbyfileid) is a wrapper of the OpenByFileId Win32 API in C#. We use this to resolve file identifiers that otherwise wouldn't be readable.

### StCroixSkippers
[StCroixSkippers](https://www.dreamincode.net/forums/blog/1017-stcroixskippers) wrote the wrapper of the UsnJournal Win32 API to C#. Without this wrapper the project wouldn't even see the light of day.
